## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use the basics of flexbox. This made aligning things much easier. I have added the home page of each site so as not to have all my personal info in one place.

### Continued development

In future I will focus on using responsive units.
